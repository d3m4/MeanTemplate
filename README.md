Proposal for base Mean Project
==================================

Sample/Template project to develop MEAN applications. This is a very opinionated view on the MEAN stack, shouldn't be taken with prejudice, this repo will be always open to collaboration and improvement.

Main Ideas of the repository are to provide a solid starting point for big projects, facilitating decisions on how to structure a multi-module app and authentication with basic oAuth2 Jwt integration.

Logging and Auditing middleware will probably be added as an additional feature, at some later point in time.
